![alt text](images/BrianRicky-web.jpg "Ricky expressing the feeling of his teachers energy")

It was Brian’s vision to combine and blend all the different techniques and 
concepts of the various styles he’d learned into the creation of a blended 
system of ‘Chinese Boxing’, later adding also Escrima into the mix, being the first in the UK to train, teach and promote Escrima.

GM Brian kept teaching this evolved Fighting style which eventually  became the 

**"Brian Jones Integrated Kun Tao System".**

Comprised of three major styles: Tai Chi Chuan, Wing Chun and Escrima.

&emsp;

# **Kun Tao Tai Chi Chuan**

# **Wing Chun** 

Is the system as it was taught to GM Brian by GM Wong Waichung / Greco Wong.

There are also Wooden Dummy Techniques unique to the Wing Chun System.

&emsp;

# **Escrima** 

Is a Filipino Martial Art with focus on weapons such as sticks, machettes and knives, as it was taught by GM Rene Latosa

The Latosa system is simple and direct, it revolves around five strikes.

The five strikes gives the basis for all attacks and defences, combined with triangle footwork and eliptial motion of movements.

The system is taught in 12 student grades alongside a form. The form is GM Brian's contribution to the latosa system.

&emsp;

# **Integrated Kun Tao** 

Has additional forms and techniques that GM Brian developed such as:

An unarmed two person set which integrates all three arts.

Two forms specially designed for the Kuntao knives

# **Grading**

Gradings are optional. Brian seldom graded to pass an exam, his grades were awarded for constant practice and over sustained periods. This practise will continue to be used under the guidance of Master Ricky.
